# preparingForTechnicalInterview

## Prepping for the Technical Interview
Idea came from mock interviews at NSS, a dozen or two after them, what if we prepared a talk going over all points which happen in every mock interview

## About speaker
Senior Software Engineer @ HODINKEE
Former Tech lead @ Asurion
Bootcamp survivor
Dont a lot of interviewing
  - at current employer
  - mock interviews of NSS students
  - recently interviewed a bunch more

## Overview
1. what to expect
2. how to prepare
3. q and a

## question types
1. behavioral
  - tell me about yourself
  - tell me about a time you did this
2. technical
  - domain knowledge
    - what is JS how does it compare to Python
  - problem solving
    - design algorithm
    - how would you...
3. cultural
  - questions about company values

- typically a blend, or could be structured

### the qorst question ' tell me about yourself'
- short, relevant to the role, few sentences
- mirrors 'about me & personal profile ' section in resume
- **Software developer** with previous experience doing X
  - NOT ..'er trying to become software developer
  - Building apps === developer
- Don't answer this question like youre just starting NSS

## Resume as a roadmap
- your resume is your guide to a successful interview
  - remove all typos
- Study your own resume
  - if you don't feel comfortable answering, then leave it off or study a one sentence answer on that software
- experience and technologies listed are fair game for questioning
- resume to fit role? 
  - for front-end role, put your front-end projects first
  - flip for back-end role

## past projects
- questions about your capstones and other coding projects give a glimpse into how you might solve problems in the future
- how is your app structured?
  - what are the different technologies you used
  - why did you use those technologies
  - what would you do differently
  - how is the data strucured
  - technical challenges you faced
  - lessons learned

## 'the onion'
- it's okay if you dont know the answer to a question. it sounds scary, but interviewers might be trying to see your depth of knowledge in a particular domain
- first asked high level question
  - continue to ask more difficult questions in that area, until you discover the depth of knowledge on aparticular subject
- okay to not know, but **not okay** to make up an answer
- try not to let 'not knowing' affect your confidence
